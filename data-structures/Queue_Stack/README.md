# Queues

A queue is a representation of element in which we can add or remove the next element.

This particular data structure supports mainly two operations:

- add(element)
- remove()

The operation of queueing an element can be done following two particular designs:

- <b>FIFO <em>(First In First Out)</em>:</b> a FIFO queue removes the elements in the same order they were added

- <b>LIFO <em>(Last In First Out)</em>:</b> a LIFO queue removes the most recently added elements.

- <b>PRIORITY QUEUE:</b> a priority queue always removes first the smallest element in the queue or following other ways of comparison.
