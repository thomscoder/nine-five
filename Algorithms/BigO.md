# Big-O Notation

When developing an algorithm it is important it is important to consider how efficient they are.

The measurements of the efficiency of an algorithm is done through a notation called Big-O.

<h3><b>What is Big-O notation?</b></h3>
Big-O notation is the "language" used for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run or how much memory it uses.
