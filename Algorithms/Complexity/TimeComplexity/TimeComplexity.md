# Time Complexity

The time an algorithm takes to run is usually not expressed directly into the time format we know (seconds, milliseconds etc...), but it is usually referred as the number of operations or steps it takes to complete a problem of size <b>n</b>.

- <b>O(1) Constant time</b>: it takes constant time to run an algorithm regardless of the size of the input. A bookmark in a book, for example, allows to retrieve a page regardless of the size of the book.

- <b>O(n) Linear time</b>: it means the run time increases at the same pace as the input. Reading a book for example.

- <b>O(n\*n) Quadratic time</b>: represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the squared size of the input data. Squared version of Linear time.

- <b>O(log n) Logarithmic Time</b>: refers to an algorithm whose runtime grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size.

- <b>O(2^n) Exponential Time</b>: refers to an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition of the input data set.
