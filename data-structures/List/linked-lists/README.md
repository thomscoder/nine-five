# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure similar to arrays but they store data in non-contiguos memory locations.

We can have different types of linked lists:

- SINGLE LINKED LIST: In single linked lists navigation is forward only (we can only go forward and never backward)

- DOUBLY LINKED LIST: Similar to the single lists but the navigation can be either forward or backward

- CIRCULAR LINKED LIST: The last element is linked to the first element of the list
