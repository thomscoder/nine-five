# Searching

Searching is the act of <b>locating information</b>

To accomplish this task we, first, need to <b>represent</b> the information that has to be searched (here is where <em>Data Structure</em> comes in); secondly, we have to <b>process</b> that information.

For example, let's search a <b>collection of integer numbers</b>.
Let's consider:

- The most simple representation.
- Two potential algorithms for processing.

For collection of numbers the most simple representation may be an <a href="../../DataStructures/List/arrays">Array</a>:

Given an array <b>a</b> and integer <b>x</b> find an integer <b>n</b> such that<b>n</b> is -1 if there is no <b>j</b> such that <b>a[j]</b> equals <b>x</b>, otherwise <b>n</b> is any <b>j</b> for which <b>a[j]</b> equals <b>x</b>.
